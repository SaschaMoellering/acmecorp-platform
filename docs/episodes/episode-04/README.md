# Episode 4 — Observability: Metrics, Health & Prometheus

## Duration
~10 minutes

## Purpose
Establish observability as a foundational capability and explain how health, metrics, and monitoring work together.

## High-Level Narrative

> If you can’t observe it, you can’t operate it.

Observability is not something you add later.  
It must be designed into the system from the start.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Health vs readiness vs liveness
- Application metrics
- Prometheus scraping
- Dashboards as hypotheses

## Architecture & Visuals

- **E04-D01-health-readiness-liveness**
- **E04-D02-prometheus-scrape-flow**
- **E04-D03-grafana-dashboard-model**

## What Is Shown
- Health and readiness endpoints
- Metrics exposure
- Prometheus configuration
- Example dashboards

## What Is Intentionally Deferred
- Alerting strategies
- Distributed tracing
- AI-based diagnostics

## Outcome of This Episode

Viewers should understand:
- what to measure first
- how signals relate to behavior
- why dashboards are starting points, not answers

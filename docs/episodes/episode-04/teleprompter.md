# Episode 4 — Teleprompter Script

> **Opening – Observability is not optional**

[SHOW: title slide – “Observability: Metrics & Health”]

Most teams only look at metrics when it’s already too late.

This episode explains how observability should be part of the system from day one.

---

> **Health, readiness, liveness**

[SHOW: E04-D01-health-readiness-liveness]

Not all health checks mean the same thing.

Readiness tells us when a service can actually handle traffic.

---

> **Metrics as signals**

[SHOW: metrics endpoint output]

Metrics are signals.

They don’t give answers by themselves.

They help us ask better questions.

---

> **Prometheus model**

[SHOW: E04-D02-prometheus-scrape-flow]

Prometheus pulls metrics.

That model has consequences for how we design our services.

---

> **Dashboards**

[SHOW: E04-D03-grafana-dashboard-model]

Dashboards are hypotheses.

They tell us where to look, not what to think.

---

> **Closing**

With observability in place, we can finally talk about performance.

That’s exactly what we’ll do next.

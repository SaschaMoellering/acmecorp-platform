# Episode 2 — Local Development & Docker Compose

## Duration
~10–12 minutes

## Purpose
Explain how developers work with the AcmeCorp Platform locally and why **local development and CI are equal architectural constraints**.

After this episode, viewers should understand why reproducible local environments are not a convenience, but a prerequisite for reliable systems.

## Target Audience
- Backend developers
- Platform engineers
- Architects designing developer workflows

## High-Level Narrative

> If a system behaves differently locally than it does in CI or production, you will debug ghosts.

This episode establishes local reproducibility as a **design requirement**, not a tooling detail.  
Docker Compose is treated as an *architectural mirror* of the system, not just a way to start containers.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Local develop
